# Portfolio-Website
A personal portfolio website built using React and Tailwind CSS.
This is my personal portfolio website built using React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Framer Motion.
It serves as a digital space to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as a web developer.
The website features a modern and responsive design, smooth animations, and an easy-to-navigate layout.

It includes key sections such as:

🧍‍♀️ About Me – A brief introduction and professional summary.

💼 Projects – Highlights of my work with links and descriptions.

🧠 Skills – Technologies and tools I use.

📩 Contact – A form and social links to get in touch.

📄 Resume Download – Option to view or download my CV.

This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of React components, routing, state management, and animation effects, while improving the overall UI/UX with Tailwind CSS.
